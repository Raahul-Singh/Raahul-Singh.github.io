# Raahul Singh's Personal Website

This is the source code for my personal website where I share essays and projects. The site is built with plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features

- Responsive design that works on desktop and mobile
- Dark mode toggle with automatic system preference detection
- Clean, content-focused layout
- Markdown-based essay system
- MathJax integration for mathematical notation
- Resume download functionality
- Contact form for direct communication
- Smooth page transitions

## Structure

- `index.html` - Home page
- `essays.html` - Collection of all essays
- `about.html` - About me page
- `contact.html` - Contact form and information
- `essay-template.html` - Template for individual essays
- `css/` - Stylesheets
- `js/` - JavaScript files
- `markdown-essays/` - Markdown files for essays
- `assets/` - Resume and other downloadable files

## Local Development

To run the website locally:

1. Clone this repository
2. Open `index.html` in your browser

Or use a local server:

```bash
# Using Python 3
python -m http.server

# Or with Node.js
npx serve
```

## Contact Form Setup

The contact form uses [Formspree](https://formspree.io) for handling form submissions. To make it work:

1. Sign up for a Formspree account
2. Create a new form and replace the placeholder email in the form action URL
3. Confirm your email with Formspree

## Acknowledgments

This website was created with the assistance of [Cursor](https://cursor.sh/), an AI-powered code editor. The use of Cursor greatly enhanced the development process, allowing for more efficient implementation of features and design elements.
