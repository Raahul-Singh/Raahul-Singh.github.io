Welcome to my digital garden where I share essays, book notes, and thoughts on a variety of topics including programming, machine learning, and ideas that matter. 

This site is organized around two main types of content:

## Essays

Essays are original pieces where I explore ideas, describe techniques, or share my thoughts on various subjects. They are more polished and represent my current thinking on topics.

## Book Reviews

Book reviews are summaries, notes, and analyses of books I've read. I include key insights, quotes, and my personal takeaways from each book.

### About This Site

This site is inspired by [Gwern Branwen's website](https://gwern.net), with its focus on clean typography, readability, and long-form content. I've built it using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) with a custom theme that emphasizes readability and supports features like sidenotes.

Feel free to browse around, and I hope you find something of interest.
