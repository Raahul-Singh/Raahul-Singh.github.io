# Digital Minimalism

Digital minimalism is a philosophy that helps you question what digital communication tools (and behaviors surrounding these tools) add the most value to your life. It is about using technology with intention and purpose.

## Core Principles

1. **Clutter is costly**: Digital clutter is mentally draining just like physical clutter
2. **Optimization is important**: Deciding which technologies to use and how to use them is complex
3. **Intentionality is satisfying**: Being more intentional about technology makes life better

## Practical Steps

- Perform a digital declutter: Take a 30-day break from optional technologies
- Rediscover offline activities that you find meaningful and satisfying
- Rebuild your digital life from scratch, adding back only the tools that serve a purpose
- Create rules for when and how you use technology

I've found that implementing simple rules like "no phones during meals" and having designated times for checking email and social media has significantly improved my focus and wellbeing.

The question isn't "is this technology good or bad?" but rather "is the way I'm using this technology supporting or detracting from the life I want to live?"
